## Phase 2 — Content Expansion (Next)

### 0. Individual Joke Share Pages (`/joke/[id]`)
**Priority: HIGH** — enables social sharing with proper preview cards. Not indexed by Google (noindex), so no thin-page penalty.

**Approach:** Single file in git (`/pages/joke/[id].js`), server-side rendered on demand via `getServerSideProps`. No static paths, no checked-in pages — Next.js generates each joke's HTML at request time.

Each joke gets a shareable URL: `/joke/abc123`
- `noindex` meta tag — Google ignores it, social crawlers read it
- Per-joke OG tags (title = joke setup, description = punchline) for proper Twitter/Facebook preview cards
- Share buttons: X (Twitter), Facebook, copy link
- Rating UI + "hear it" button

**Share tracking:**
- Add `shares` counter to STATS_TABLE per joke (`PK: STATS#<jokeId>`, `SK: AGGREGATE`)
- New API endpoint `POST /api/share` — increments share count by platform (x, facebook, copy)
- Dashboard updated to show most-shared jokes alongside most-rated

**Category page integration:**
- Share URL from category pages: `/joke/abc123` (standalone)
- Or deep-link into category: `/jokes/food?id=abc123` — category page scrolls to / highlights that joke

**Implementation plan:**
1. Create `/pages/joke/[id].js` — `getServerSideProps` looks up joke by ID from JSON data
2. Add `noindex` + per-joke OG/Twitter meta tags
3. Create `/api/share.js` — POST endpoint records share events in STATS_TABLE
4. Add `ShareButtons` component (`components/ShareButtons.js`) — X, Facebook, copy link
5. Add "Share" button to homepage joke card linking to `/joke/[id]`

### 1. Category Pages (`/jokes/[category]`)
**Priority: HIGH** — biggest SEO surface area, each page targets a unique long-tail keyword cluster.

Target categories and their keywords:
| Category | URL | Target Keywords |
|----------|-----|-----------------|
| Animals | `/jokes/animals` | animal dad jokes, funny animal jokes, cat jokes, dog jokes |
| Food | `/jokes/food` | food dad jokes, cooking jokes, pizza jokes |
| Science | `/jokes/science` | science jokes, chemistry jokes, biology jokes |
| Technology | `/jokes/technology` | tech jokes, programmer jokes, computer jokes |
| Sports | `/jokes/sports` | sports dad jokes, baseball jokes, football jokes |
| Work | `/jokes/work` | office jokes, work humor, boss jokes |
| School | `/jokes/school` | school jokes, teacher jokes, homework jokes |
| Weather | `/jokes/weather` | weather jokes, rain jokes, winter jokes |

**Implementation plan:**
1. Tag each joke in the dataset with 1-2 categories (script that keyword-matches joke text)
2. Add `category` field to `fatherhood_jokes.json` and `external_jokes.json`
3. Create `/pages/jokes/[category].js` — static pages via `getStaticPaths` + `getStaticProps` with ISR
4. Each joke on category page links to its individual joke page (`/jokes/[id]`)
5. Add category filter to the homepage random joke button (optional)

---

### 2. "This Week's Best" Page (`/weekly`)
**Priority: MEDIUM** — fresh content signal, encourages repeat visits

- Dynamically shows the top-rated jokes from the past 7 days
- Rebuilt weekly via ISR (`revalidate: 3600`)
- Target keywords: "best dad jokes this week", "funniest dad jokes 2026", "top dad jokes"
- Add to sitemap with `changefreq: weekly`

---

### 3. Submit Page (`/submit`)
**Priority: MEDIUM** — dedicated landing page for user submissions

Currently: submission is a modal on the homepage (not indexable)
Goal: full `/submit` page with:
- Tips for writing a great dad joke
- Examples of top-rated community submissions
- The submission form
- Target keywords: "submit a dad joke", "share your dad joke", "add your own joke"

---

## Phase 3 — Authority Building

### 4. "What Makes a Great Dad Joke?" Guide
**Priority: MEDIUM** — topical authority, link magnet

Long-form content (~1,000 words) covering:
- The anatomy of a dad joke (setup, punchline, groan factor)
- Why bad jokes are psychologically satisfying
- Tips for writing your own
- Examples from the top-rated collection

Target keywords: "how to write a dad joke", "what makes a good dad joke", "dad joke formula"

URL: `/guide` or `/blog/what-makes-a-great-dad-joke`

---

### 5. API Documentation Page (`/api-docs`)
**Priority: LOW-MEDIUM** — developer backlinks, brand mentions

Expose a public `/api/random-joke` endpoint (already exists) with docs:
- How to fetch a random joke
- Response format
- Rate limits
- Example integrations (Slack, Discord, etc.)

Why it matters: developer communities link to APIs. icanhazdadjoke gets significant traffic from devs. Positions joshkurz.net as an alternative/complement.

---

### 6. "Dad Jokes Hall of Fame" Social Sharing
**Priority: LOW** — covered by individual joke pages (Phase 2, item 0) which handle per-joke OG images and share buttons natively.
