= Hello World, Prepare to Groan

You know how every new project starts with a "Hello World"?
Yeah… well this one starts with something far more important:

A Dad.
With jokes.
And no one to stop him.

Welcome to JoshKurz.net — a place where the jokes are like my lawn:
I'll tell them whether you want them or not.

== So, Why a Dad Joke Website?

Because someone once told me:

"With great power comes great responsibility."

But I misheard it as:

"With great pun-er comes great possibility."

And honestly? That just feels more on brand.

Also, my children can only run so fast.
The internet, however, cannot escape.

== Let's Set Expectations

If you're here for:

* ✅ Groan-inducing punchlines
* ✅ Eye-rolling one-liners
* ✅ Jokes so cheesy that lactose intolerant people must look away

You're in the right place.

If you're here for:

* ❌ Nuanced irony
* ❌ Aristotelian narrative arcs
* ❌ Humor that would impress anyone under age 15

Uh, maybe just… stick around anyway. It builds character.

== A Sample to Get You Started

Q: Why don't eggs tell jokes?
A: They'd crack each other up.

I'll show myself out.
(No I won't. This is my website.)

Q: What do you call a factory that makes okay products?
A: A satisfactory.

I promise they'll get better.
(They will not get better.)

== Final Thoughts

This site has a simple goal:
To share joy, one groan at a time.

If at any point you laugh against your will — you owe me a high five.
If you don't laugh… don't worry. I have hundreds more.
I have become unstoppable.

Welcome to the dad joke dimension.
Take a seat. Buckle up.
There is no escape.

— Josh
